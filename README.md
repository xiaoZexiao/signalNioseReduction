# signalNioseReduction
robot signal noise reduction by using the Kalman filter

# information from my superviser 
Your global goal is to develop a robot program that will filter data from sensors.

A good filter for such tasks is the Kalman filter, (https://habr.com/ru/post/140274/, https://habr.com/ru/post/166693/).

This global goal is divided into several small tasks:

1) Understand how the Kalman filter works, simulate it in Simulink.
2) Understand how to program STM32 controllers.
3) Make a software implementation of the filter on a microcontroller.

One of the conditions for working on a project is to come and work in the laboratory on this project at least 2 times a week.
